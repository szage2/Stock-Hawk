# Stock-Hawk
Stock Hawk was a given application that I've made production ready based on user feedbacks. The application lists desired stocks for the user. After clicking on a stock  a graph would be displayed with historical data. Using the app's widget is even more handy as selecting a listed stock on the widget will directly navigate to it's graph.
